Add the marinated chicken and cook until the chicken is 70-80% done. The chicken should still be juicy and not fully cooked, as it will finish cooking with the rice.<br><br>
                                <b>Layer the Biryani</b><br><br>
                                <b>6.Layer the Biryani: </b><br>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, layer half of the cooked rice. Add the chicken and masala mixture on top.

                                <b>7.Dum Cooking: </b><br>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can seal the edges with dough to ensure the steam doesn't escape. Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes (this method is called "dum" cooking) until the flavors meld together and the rice is fully cooked. Alternatively, you can place the pot in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 25-30 minutes.<br><br>
                                <b>Serve</b><br><br>
                                <b>8.Fluff and Serve: </b><br>Gently fluff the rice with a fork, mixing the layers. Serve hot with raita, salad, or any side dish of your choice.<br><br>

                                <b>3. Make the Batter:</b><br> Mix well and gradually add water as needed to make a thick, sticky batter. The consistency should be thick enough to hold its shape when dropped into oil but not too stiff.<br><br>
                                <b>4. Rest the Batter: </b><br>Let the batter rest for about 15-20 minutes. This helps in making the bajjis soft and fluffy.<br><br>

                                <b>5. Heat Oil: </b><br>In a deep frying pan or kadai, heat oil on medium heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.<<br><br>
                               <b>6.  Drop Batter: </b><br>Once the oil is hot, take small portions of the batter (you can use your fingers or a spoon) and drop them carefully into the hot oil. Fry in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan.<br><br>
                                <b>7. Fry Until Golden: </b><br>Fry the golibajje until they turn golden brown and crispy on all sides. Make sure the oil is at a consistent medium heat so that the inside cooks well without burning the outside.<br><br>
                                <b>8. Drain: </b><br>Remove the fried golibajje with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.<br><br>
                                <b>Serve</b><br><br>
                                <b>9. Serve Hot: </b><br>Serve golibajje hot with coconut chutney, tomato ketchup, or any dip of your choice.<br><br><br>

                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <p>
                            Bread Slices: 6-8 (white bread or milk bread)<br>
Milk: 2 cups<br>
Sugar: 1 cup (adjust to taste)<br>
Ghee: 4-5 tbsp (for frying)<br>
Cardamom Powder: 1/2 tsp<br>
Saffron: A few strands (soaked in 2 tbsp warm milk)<br>
Nuts: 2 tbsp (almonds, cashews, and pistachios, chopped)<br>
Raisins: 1 tbsp (optional)<br>
Water: 1/2 cup (for sugar syrup)<br>
Rose Water or Kewra Water: 1 tsp (optional, for flavor)<br><br></p>
                        <h3>Process</h3><br>
                        <p>
                            <b>Prepare the Bread</b><br><br>
                                <b>1. Toast the Bread:</b><br> Cut the bread slices into halves or quarters, removing the crust if preferred. Heat 2-3 tbsp of ghee in a frying pan, and fry the bread pieces until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides. Set them aside on a paper towel to drain excess ghee.<br><br>
                                <b>Toast the Bread:</b>><br><br>
                                <b>2. Prepare Sugar Syrup:</b><br> In a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely. Add cardamom powder and rose water or kewra water (if using) for added flavor. Once the syrup is slightly thickened, remove from heat and set aside.<br><br>
                                <b>Cook the Milk</b><br><br>
                                <b>3. Boil the Milk:</b><br> In another pan, bring the milk to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until the milk reduces slightly and thickens. Add the saffron-soaked milk to the mixture and stir well.<br><br>
                                <b>Assemble the Double Ka Meetha</b><br><br>
                                <b>4. Layer the Bread:</b><br> Arrange the fried bread pieces in a shallow dish or pan.<br><br>
                                <b>5. Add the Syrup and Milk:</b>><br> Pour the warm sugar syrup evenly over the bread slices, ensuring they soak up the syrup. Then, pour the thickened milk over the bread.<br><br>
                                <b>6. Garnish:</b><br> Sprinkle the chopped nuts and raisins (if using) over the top.<br><br>
                                <b>Cook and Serve</b><br><br>
                                <b>7. Simmer or Bake:</b><br> Cover the dish and simmer on low heat for 10-15 minutes until the bread absorbs the milk and flavors. Alternatively, you can bake it in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for about 20 minutes until the top is slightly golden and bubbly.<br><br>
                                <b>8. Serve Warm: </b><br>Double Ka Meetha is best served warm, either as it is or with a scoop of ice cream on the side for an extra indulgence.<br><br><br>
                                Enjoy your Double Ka Meetha! This rich, flavorful dessert is a perfect treat for special occasions or whenever you crave something sweet and satisfying.

                    <h2>Dibba Rotti </h2>
                        <p>Dibba Rotti is a traditional Andhra dish, also known as Minapa Rotti. It’s a thick, crispy pancake made from urad dal (black gram) and rice rava (coarse rice flour). This dish is often enjoyed as a breakfast item or a snack and pairs well with chutneys or pickle.</p>
                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <p>
                            Urad Dal (Black Gram): 1 cup<br>
Rice Rava (Coarse Rice Flour): 2 cups<br>
Cumin Seeds: 1 tsp<br>
Green Chilies: 2-3, finely chopped<br>
Ginger: 1-inch piece, finely chopped<br>
Salt: To taste<br>
Oil/Ghee: For cooking (about 4-5 tbsp)<br><br></p>
                        <h3>Process</h3><br>
                        <p>
                            <b>Prepare the Batter</b><br><br>
                                <b>1. Soak the Urad Dal: </b><br>Wash and soak the urad dal in water for about 4-5 hours, or overnight.<br><br>
                                <b>2. Grind the Dal: </b><br>Drain the soaked dal and grind it into a smooth, thick batter using minimal water. The consistency should be similar to that of idli batter.<br><br>
                                <b>3. Mix with Rice Rava:</b><br> In a large mixing bowl, combine the urad dal batter with rice rava. If using store-bought rice rava, rinse it once before mixing it into the batter. Add salt, cumin seeds, chopped green chilies, and ginger. Mix well. The batter should be thick but spreadable. Let it rest for about 30 minutes.<br><br>
                                <b>Cook the Dibba Rotti</b><br><br>
                                <b>4. Heat the Pan: </b><br>Use a heavy-bottomed pan or cast iron skillet (traditionally, a thick iron kadai is used). Add about 2-3 tbsp of oil or ghee to the pan and heat it over medium heat.<br><br>
                                <b>5. Spread the Batter: </b><br>Once the oil is hot, pour a thick layer of batter (about 1 inch thick) into the pan. Spread it gently with a ladle or spoon to even out the surface.<br><br>
                                <b>6. Cover and Cook:</b><br> Cover the pan with a lid and cook on low heat for 10-15 minutes, or until the bottom of the rotti turns golden brown and crispy.<br><br>
                                <b>7. Flip and Cook the Other Side:</b><br> Carefully flip the dibba rotti using a spatula. Add a little more oil or ghee around the edges if needed. Cover and cook the other side for another 10-15 minutes until it's crispy and golden brown as well.<br><br>
                                <b>Serve</b><br><br>
                                <b>8. Serve Hot: </b><br>Once both sides are crispy and cooked through, remove the dibba rotti from the pan. Cut it into wedges or pieces and serve hot with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, or any pickle of your choice.<br><br><br>
                                Enjoy your Dibba Rotti! This dish is a delightful combination of a crispy outer layer and a soft, fluffy interior, making it a perfect comfort food.
